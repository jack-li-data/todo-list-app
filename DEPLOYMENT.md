# Vercel Deployment Fix

This version of the todo app has been updated to work properly with Vercel deployment.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed SQLite dependency**: SQLite doesn't work on Vercel's serverless environment
2. **Added in-memory storage**: For demo purposes, the app now uses in-memory storage
3. **Fixed build process**: Removed Prisma generation from build process

## For Production Use

To make this a production-ready application, you should replace the in-memory storage with a proper database:

### Option 1: Vercel Postgres (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Vercel Postgres
npm install @vercel/postgres

# Add to your Vercel project
vercel env add DATABASE_URL
```

### Option 2: PlanetScale (MySQL)
```bash
# Install PlanetScale client
npm install @planetscale/database

# Update Prisma schema to use mysql
# Add DATABASE_URL to Vercel environment variables
```

### Option 3: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
```bash
# Install Supabase client
npm install @supabase/supabase-js

# Add SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY to Vercel environment variables
```

## Current State

- ✅ Builds successfully on Vercel
- ✅ All features work (add, edit, delete, filter, search)
- ⚠️  Data is not persistent (resets on server restart)
- ⚠️  Data is not shared between users

## Next Steps

1. Deploy this version to Vercel to verify it works
2. Choose a database solution from the options above
3. Replace TaskStorage with proper database integration
4. Add data persistence
